This repository explores common object relationships found in object-oriented programming, including "is-a", "has-a", and "uses-a" relationships. These relationships are fundamental in designing object-oriented systems and understanding how classes and objects interact with each other.

**Is-a Relationship**
The "is-a" relationship, also known as inheritance, signifies a subclass's relationship with its superclass. In this relationship, the subclass shares common characteristics with its superclass and may extend its behavior.

**Has-a Relationship**
The "has-a" relationship, also known as composition, indicates that one class contains another class as a member. This relationship implies that a class has components or parts that contribute to its functionality.

**Uses-a Relationship**
The "uses-a" relationship implies that one class utilizes the functionality of another class without being a part of its hierarchy. This relationship often involves method invocation, dependency injection, or object collaboration.
